This repository consists of all the practicals which we have performed this semester along with their detailed description of each.

[Git and Git-Hub - 22CSH-293](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/tree/Git-and-GitHub)

Git and GitHub are integral tools in the software development process. Git's distributed version control system enables efficient collaboration, branching, and merging, while GitHub provides a web-based platform with additional features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project management tools. Together, these tools empower developers to work seamlessly, manage projects effectively, and ensure the integrity of their codebase throughout the development lifecycle.

Experiments:-
1. [Installation of Git and Create repository](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Git-and-GitHub/Experiment%201.pdf)
   In this experiment, we got to know about how to install Git on different operating devices with their different versions, and also acquired knowledge about how to create a repository with Git and GitHub.
   
2. [Creating branches with GitHub](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Git-and-GitHub/Experiment%202.pdf)
   In this experiment, we learned about different ways of creating branches, using Git and GitHub.

3. [Create and explore Pull request](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Git-and-GitHub/Experiment%203.pdf)
   In this experiment, we enhanced ourselves by learning how to create and explore Pull requests, on Git and GitHub.

4. [Editing a file and committing changes on GitHub](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Git-and-GitHub/Experiment%204.pdf)
   In this experiment, we learned to edit a file and commit changes to it on GitHub.
